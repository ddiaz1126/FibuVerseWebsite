  },
  "sit_ups_test": {
    "description": "This test evaluates abdominal and core muscular endurance. A higher number of sit-ups performed indicates stronger core muscles, contributing to better posture, spinal support, and overall functional performance in daily tasks and sports.",

  },
  "pull_ups_test": {
    "description": "Pull-ups assess upper body pulling strength and endurance, particularly targeting the back, biceps, and forearms. Higher repetitions demonstrate superior upper body strength and functional capacity for lifting and pulling activities.",

  },
  "bench_press_1rm_kg": {
    "description": "The one-repetition maximum (1RM) bench press measures maximal upper body strength, focusing on the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Higher 1RM values indicate greater muscular power, which can be useful for athletic performance, strength training programming, and functional upper body tasks.",

  "leg_press_1rm_kg": {
    "description": "The leg press 1RM evaluates maximal lower body strength, primarily targeting the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. Higher values reflect superior leg power and strength, essential for athletic activities, functional movements, and lower body conditioning.",
